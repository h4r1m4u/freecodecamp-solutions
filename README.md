# freeCodeCamp Solutions

## About
[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is an amazing initiative and an excellent  free resource helping thousands of people in  learning to code. This respository captures my personal solutions to a number of their challenges and exercises. 

Initially, it was just a locally hosted collection of files and folders to keep a track of my own progress through the curriculum, but eventually I decided to publicaly share the solutions with the intention of helping other students who might get stuck or who might want to see how someone else approached the same exercise and learn from their approach.

Just like freeCodeCamp, this repository is meant to be a learning resource assisting you in your quest to become a proficient web developer. It is not meant to let you copy and paste the solutions, so that you can get through the curriculum as quickly as possible. 

Do the challenges on your own, write your own code that passes the tests, and consult this repository only if you truly have no idea how to pass an exercise or to check if there is perhaps a better, simpler or more efficient way of solving it. 

Copying the solutions into the freeCodeCamp editor might let you cheat your way through the system, but it will not help you become a better developer. The only person you will be cheating to is yourself. 

## Pull Requests
freeCodeCamp is a living project that develops and changes over time. I started this repository back in 2015 and I do not actively monitor or track the latest freeCodeCamp developments. As such, some of the solutions may be outdated or even irrelevant. The same goes for the file structure, exercise names, etc.

You are welcome to create pull requests and when you do, I will look at them, check freeCodeCamp and consider whether to merge them into the codebase. This serves both the purpose of keeping the repository useful and relatively up to date and also gives you the opportunity to learn how to use Git and contribute to open-source projects. 

However, before creating a pull request, please double-check your code and make sure that your proposed update passes the freeCodeCamp tests or correctly reflects any changes to the exercises. Please **do not** make me waste my time on incorrect changes or pull requests that do not work.
